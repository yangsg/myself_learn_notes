```
On yum-based distributions, the only MariaDB user set up is root, and there is no password. You can use the mysql_secure_installation script to set the root password.
For compatibility, the service name and port are by default the same as MySQL: mysql and 3306. Binaries are also named the same: mysqld for the server and mysql for the client.
After installation you can start MariaDB with sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start or sudo service mysql start
```
