## HTMLCollection
### Usage in JavaScript

HTMLCollection also exposes its members directly as properties by both name and index. HTML IDs may contain : and . as valid characters,
which would necessitate using bracket notation for property access. Currently HTMLCollections does not recognize purely numeric IDs,
which would cause conflict with the array-style access, though HTML5 does permit these.
