- [3.2.2 Boolean attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080610/semantics.html)
A number of attributes in HTML5 are boolean attributes. The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.

If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or a value that is a case-insensitive match for the attribute's canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace.
